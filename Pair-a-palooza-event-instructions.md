# Pair-A-Palooza Event Instructions

## Summary
Pair-A-Palooza is really just a way to get folks to pair more within a certain timeframe. 
the bulk of the work is making sure folks understand how to fill out the zine, and that scheduling does indeed happen,
which can be implemented using whatever scheduling mechanism you have. 

## Steps

### 1. Choose a Timeframe
Events work best when they have a start and end. 
For my first pair-a-palooza, I chose 3 days for folks to take 1-hr time slots to pair with me. This can vary based on 
how many folks are pairing, and what your groups workload looks like. I'd reccomend choosing at least a few weeks ahead of you,
for your first time, to prepare the zines, but once those are created, you could do pair-a-palooza anytime!

### 2. Distribute Zines
Using the PDF template, distribute a blank zine to everyone who wants to be involved and have them fill it out. 
(_at this point, its useful to have had yours filled out already as well, so you can field questions, and share yours to review_)
Here's an explainer for what can go in each page, or feel free to modify the zine to take your own info!

### 3. Collect Zines
Allow folks to take some time to fill out the zine, but give a deadline to collect them. 
It's great to have a place for them to live, so folks can review at their leisure without having to ask the author for it.

### 4. Peruse Zines
Before scheduling time with folks, its useful to be able to review zines, and get an understanding of what folks 
want to pair on, and allow for time to prepare before pairing.

### 5. Pick Your Pairs
You can "Schedule appointment slots" on Google Calendar, or use a site like Calendy to have at least a few slots folks can
claim to pair with you.


### 6. Pair-A-Palooza!
Make it happen! Pair with folks!


### 7. Stamp your passport
After you pair with someone, there's a second, inside page, of your zine, that you can document when folks paired with you
which you can use to have them write a note about pairing with you, or to reflect on your own about how it went.
