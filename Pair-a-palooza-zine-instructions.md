**Quirk** - This is a hat-tip to Dev Bootcamp, where we would always introduce ourselves with our names, our cohort name,

_Content: How I Roll..._

This section is where you'll put some of the ways you like to work, what is your setup like? 
what should someone know before they sit in your space, using your tools? This section can be a bit developer-heavy, but you
can update it to whatever kind of setup things folks should know to work well with you.

**My Editor** - Text editor you use

**My Shell** - command line shell

**Keyboard** - have a special kind of keyboard?

**Fave Plugin** - Folks often forget what theyve setup to make their lives easier, and it can be a burden for others trying to pair, 
its nice to know this stuff upfront first!

## Page 4
_Content: ...Technologically_

Theres more space to add more technical quirks you have!

**Tabs or Spaces** - a silly, but sometimes useful thing to know about how a person spaces their code out...

**Mouse or Trackpad** - suprisingly enough, this could be very jarring not to know about a person before you pair with them!
