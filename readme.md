# Get-zine to Know You

This is a workshop developed by Kal Keckler, for the purpose of team building and self reflection. It was born out of the alumnx project at Write/Speak/Code 2017 as a cross between Amy Wibowo's (@sailorhg) "Writing a Technical Zine" workshop and Allison McMillian's (@allie_p) "You Better Work...Shop" workshop. 

## Getting Started

Is workshop right for you? It is built out of a passion for development, inclusion, and diversity, so if those things aren't important for you, perhaps you should find a different resource.

Make sure to have access to the 16 Personalities Test  (www.16personalities.com)

This is an arts and crafts kind of workshop! Don't be afraid of stepping outside the box, it might not be perfect and thats alright. You can do a rough draft before making the zine. 

## Recommended Materials

- Pens
- Markers
- Crayons
- Paper (computer paper works best)
- Computer (or a way to take the 16 personalities test)
- Scissors

## Goals

1) Develop some self awareness
2) Foster communications in teams
3) Excerise your creative side


## Running the Workshop

This workshop could take up to two hours, depending on the speed that people complete the personality test and how much work is put into the zine.

### Trigger

This is when you discuss the purpose of the workshop. What possible situations could have lead to needing a workshop like this?

### Discussion

- Decompress from the project
- What did you like?
- What didn't you like?
- What was easy?
- Practice making space for people to talk, not to chime in, and get comfortable with silence

### Conclusion

Come together and share your zines. Was there anything that you didn't know about your coworkers? Or your teams?
