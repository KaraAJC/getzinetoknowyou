# Pair-A-Palooza

Pair-A-Palooza is an experience created by Kara Carrell, as a way to scope a block of time to pair with as many colleagues as possible during their apprenticeship. 

Using Get-Zine-To-Know-You with Pair-A-Palooza, Kara created a zine to accompany the event, and a process for introducing it with a work group.

This is a Lunch & Learn presentation on Zines I ran at TableXI that inspired the pair-a-palooza zine

## Inspiration

Get-Zine to Know You is a workshop developed by Kal Keckler, for the purpose of team building and self reflection. It was born out of the alumnx project at Write/Speak/Code 2017 as a cross between Amy Wibowo's (@sailorhg) "Writing a Technical Zine" workshop and Allison McMillian's (@allie_p) "You Better Work...Shop" workshop.
